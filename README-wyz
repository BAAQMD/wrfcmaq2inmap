WRF-CMAQ Preprocessor for InMAP
-------------------------------

Overview:
===========================
These scripts prepare CMAQ concentration and WRF meteorology output to be read into the InMAP preprocessing system. 
Conversions are made to align WRF and CMAQ data spatially along the x, y, and z axes. The MCIP METCRO3D files is used to calculate altitude.
Data slicing is used to obtain and align data temporally.
The resulting netCDF file is read into a modified version of the wrfchem InMAP preprocessing module.
In the interest of leveraging existing libraries and modules this process involves two steps using two different languages.

Requirements:
===========================
- The wrfcmaq2inmap script requires python 3.5+ with modules netCDF4 (1.2.9+), numpy (1.12+), and pandas (0.20.1+).
- revised InMAP 1.9.0, can be downloaded from: https://github.com/yuzhou-wang/inmap
- CMAQ, WRF, and MCIP METCRO3D daily output.


1. Installation of wrfcmaq2inmap_2018
===========================
The wrfcmaq2inmap libraries must be installed before the scripts can be used. The installation script checks that the module requirements are met.
To install into your user path run:
python setup.py install --user
Missing modules can be installed using pip. For example, if numpy is missing you can try "pip install numpy>=1.12 --user".

2. Preprocessing of inputs:
===========================
- WRF output files in each chunk.

- The CMAQ output including CCTM_CONC and METCRO3D should be unziped. Could use "gunzip" command to unzip files, e.g. 
gunzip METCRO3D_20180101.nc.gz


3. WRF and CMAQ Output Processing:
===========================
The processer, wrfcmaq2inmap, takes WRF meteorological outputs and CMAQ concentration outputs and combines them into a single netCDF file with the same dimensions.
The daily processed netCDFs contain the variables needed to be passed to the InMAP preprocessor.

Steps:
1) update "work", "wrfpath", "mcippath", "cmaqpath"
2) cd to the directory that contain "gen_wrfcmaq_2018_batch_1km.csh", and then run the script using csh:
csh gen_wrfcmaq_2018_batch_1km.csh

4. Install the revised inmap
===========================
Steps:
1) git clone https://github.com/yuzhou-wang/inmap.git # Download the code.
2) cd inmap # Move into the InMAP directory
3) GO111MODULE=on go build ./cmd/inmap # Compile the InMAP executable.


5. InMAP Preprocessing:
===========================
Steps: 
1) cd to the path: path/to/wrfcmaq2inmap_2018/scripts/inmap/inmap
2) update the path of "InMAPData" and "WRFOut" in "WRFCmaq_2018_1km_batch.toml"
"WRFOut" path should be the same as the path of "outfile" in "gen_wrfcmaq_2018_batch_1km.csh"
3) update the paths in "inmap_preproc_1km_batch.csh"
4) run the inmap_preproc_1km_batch.csh script
csh inmap_preproc_1km_batch.csh

6. Done!
